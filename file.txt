Hi Luis,

I hope you are doing well. 
Following is the report for IQ2:

Q1:

Some of the students had difficulty in part 4 mainly because of misspecification of the value of f(x) at point one

Q2:

Very few students were able to come up with a justification of making denominator equal zero and more importantly with is the difference between f(x) and f*(x)


Sincerely,
Yasi, Mahdi, Omid
